The room code ensures that users connect to the same chat room, allowing private or group conversations.

Messages wrap onto the next line for easy reading.
### 3. Real-Time Messaging
  Users send messages in real-time by typing in the input field and pressing "Send Message" or hitting "Enter."
Messages instantly appear in the chat window.
### 4. Join/Leave Notifications
  Informative notifications signal when users join or leave the chat room.
### 5. Text Wrapping
  Long messages are handled with automatic text wrapping, preventing horizontal scrolling and maintaining a neat chat display.
### 6. Enter Key Support
  Pressing "Enter" in the input field is the same as clicking "Send Message,".
### 7. Personalization
  Users personalize their chat experience by setting a custom nickname.

### 8. Room Code Connection
  The room code connects users to the same chat room.
